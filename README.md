# TopicModeling_LDA

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) applied to 2,000 PubMed abstracts using collapsed Gibbs sampling to discover 20 latent biomedical topics.

Model quality was evaluated using topic coherence metrics (c_v & c_npmi), indicating interpretable biomedical topics.



See the full implementation and results in [LDA.ipynb](LDA.ipynb).
